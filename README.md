<h2 align="center">USING IMAGE PROCESSING ALGORITHMS</h2>

This Final Year Project(2014) for **Electronics & Communication Engineering** Department in **Kalyani Government Engineering College** was completed in collaboration amongst *[Brijesh Mondal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brijesh-iitd/)*, *[Pranshu Chakraborty](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pranshuc1/)*, *Joydip Panja*, *Kanu Soren* under the guidance of *Dr. [Himadri Sekhar Dutta](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Himadri-Sekhar-Dutta) (Assistant Professor, KGEC)*.

This project applies the process and knowledge of digital signal processing and image processing to diagnose diabetic retinopathy from images of retina using MATLAB 2013a. The Processing stage equalizes the uneven illumination associated with raw images and also removes noise present in the image. Segmentation stage clusters the image into two distinct classes while the Disease Classifier stage was used to distinguish between candidate lesions and other information. Method of diagnosis of red spots, bleeding and detection of vein-artery crossover points were also developed in this work using the color information, shape, size, object and length to breadth ratio as contained in the digital fundus image in the detection of this disease.
